# Blood Disease Detection using Machine Learning

Machine learning pipeline for detecting hematological disorders such as **Thalassemia** and **Multiple Myeloma** using:

- CBC datasets
- HPLC parameters  
- Scatter plot-derived features  


## Problem Statement

Early detection of blood disorders is critical but often requires invasive or specialized testing.  
This project explores whether routine hematology data can be leveraged to build predictive ML models for disease risk detection.


## Models Implemented

- Diagnostic Model
- Early Risk Model 
- Model evaluation using:
  - ROC-AUC
  - Accuracy
  - Classification Report
  - Feature Importance Analysis
